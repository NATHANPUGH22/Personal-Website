        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h6>Hello! I'm Nathan Pugh, I am passionate about the law, as I want my career to be as an attorney with a strong commitment to ethics and hard work. My journey began in San Francisco, where I discovered my love for the law at an Intensive Law and Trial program at Stanford University in the summer of my junior year.

            I have a diverse set of skills that range from electrical engineering to speech and debate, I thrive on challenges that allow me to learn and grow. I currentley am a junior at Culver City High School.
            
            When I’m not at an extra curricular , you can find me modding nerf blasters or playing video games, which fuels my creativity and inspires my projects. I believe in the power of collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning and I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals.
            
            I’m excited to share my work with you and look forward to opportunities to collaborate and create meaningful projects together!
